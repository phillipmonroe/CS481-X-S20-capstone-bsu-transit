Week 4

Note: The sponsor was not here today, so we couldnt get user stories

Working on scoping on what the employer (user) can do?
What the database might look like?
Can we get a multiple tickets in one order?
How will we set up the accounts? using current accounts? creating new accounts
from the company?
How is the company going to input their users?
What information do we need for the user?
What kind of pass?
What can we change to the current code?
Do we expire the tickets expire as soon as the person is done working?

Work that can be done:
Getting UI setup.
Adding login skeleton for both admin and employer.
Creating schema for database.

Homework:
We need add functionality that will allow the employee to upload an excel
file with all the current employees and allow to find the differences.

start creating schema for database. 

Week 6

Got logins today to the masabi api.

answers from Katie
Only 31 day passes.
We are only creating a linear path from the employer to the tickets
Probably going to start everyone on the same day per employer.
At some point, we might add functionality to add users that are not already 
users


We did user stories and tasks. then handed out tasks to people.

Week 7

Went around and updated everyone on where we are with tasks. 

Everyone is up to date with what they are doing

We also chose tasks for the next sprint.

Week 8

First we round tabled what we had done in the past week.

We had some discussions on what to use for the database handler.
I we decided on an orm.

We made a plan to do a demo for city go in the first week of april.

I am going to continue working on a scheduler. I am going to moved towards
using a cron like 3rd party scheduler to kick off my script.
