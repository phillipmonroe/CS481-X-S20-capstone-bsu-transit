Feb. 6

Note: The sponsor was not here today, so we couldnt get user stories

Working on scoping on what the employer (user) can do?
What the database might look like?
Can we get a multiple tickets in one order?
How will we set up the accounts? using current accounts? creating new accounts
from the company?
How is the company going to input their users?
What information do we need for the user?
What kind of pass?
What can we change to the current code?
Do we expire the tickets expire as soon as the person is done working?

Work that can be done:
Getting UI setup.
Adding login skeleton for both admin and employer.
Creating schema for database.
