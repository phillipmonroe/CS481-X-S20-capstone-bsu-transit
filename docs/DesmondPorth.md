## 2/6/2020
Met with sponsor. Started to plan the design around the two user stories we came up with during our first meeting. Those being:  
&nbsp;&nbsp; - As an Employer/Staff I want to add passes to an Employee/Student  
&nbsp;&nbsp; - As a CityGo admin I want to adminster Employees  
Questions for Masabi:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;What identifies an account (Rider object in API diagram)?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we get that information for an existing account?  
Questions for Katie:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of passes are we going to adminster to Employees? 31 day pass, permanent pass?  
Homework specific for myself  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Add initial Angular files to our project code base  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accomplished with ng new  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Look into using a third party to manage logins to our front end  

## 2/13/2020  
Use Google single sign in to manage login authentication.  
Developed more clear questions for Katie:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of ticket do we provision?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Login system would we be limited to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google SSO  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auth0  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will users be able to buy other passes using CityGo account  
Developed more clear questions for Masabi:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;What identifies a rider?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have access to that Resource?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to product?  
Upon termination grace period is remaining employee pass 
Employer pays CityGo base membership, pushing passes
Employer pays CityGo base membership, not pushing passes
Unaffiliated, city go manages pushing passes
